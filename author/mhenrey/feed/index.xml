<p>Sunset was the perfect time to visit. Traffic in the area is not great during the day (even worse at rush hour), but in the evening it was light. The sunset over the river was beautiful, this is a fantastic place for an evening stroll. There are a number of boardwalks and piers to walk out on over the river where you can see the sights and the wildlife.</p>

<p>There is a lot of new construction in the area, and will be for a few years to come. This brings the downside of construction traffic and noise. Transit access in the area is limited &#8211; there are bus stops along Marine Drive, but this area is a long way from either SkyTrain. While you can walk along the Fraser River, you can&#8217;t get many other places easily without a car.</p>
<p>In summary, the River District is one of the more scenic places in Vancouver. You can walk out your door and be on the Fraser River. But besides the river, there is not much else in walking distance. The commute to downtown is 45 minutes on transit, and 30-60 by car.</p>
